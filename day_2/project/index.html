        No frills here: Black coffee is made from plain ground coffee beans that

      <p class="title-el">Decaf</p>
      <p>
        Coffee beans naturally contain caffeine, but roasters can use several
        different processes to remove almost all of it. Decaf coffee is brewed
        with these decaffeinated beans..

        Is there anything better than a glass of iced coffee on a hot day (or
        any day, for that matter)? The simplest way to make it: Brew a regular
        cup of hot coffee, then cool it over ice. Add whatever milk and
        sweeteners you like
      </p>
